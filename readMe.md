MyOwnDictionary
===============

MyOwnDictionary is an open source project wich aims to help people who are learning foreign languages.
You can create your "dictionary" with two selected languages, and then, add words who you learn.
After that you can look at your dictionary or use the test fonction to check if you know the words you
learnt and their translation.


ToDo Before test version
========================
1. Center login_Page.php and sign_up.php elements and make better design.
2. When user adds word and translation, refresh directly the words and translations table to show new entries.
3. When user erase or edit a word and his translation, keep table open.
4. When user is making test : hide button "faire un test", when test is finish erase test area, add button
to show mistake if user wants.


ToDo Before finish version
========================
1. Add function erase dictionary.
2. Function show words : show just words and translations by letter ( [a], [b], [c], [d]...)
3. Registration : verify email, add function "I forget my password", capotcha.
4. Responsive design.
5. React.js
6. Add function change app language.
7. Google Play .... :)


Other idea of Function
======================
1. Function search by word or translation.
2. Function auto completion of word and translation when user is tapping a word in "add a word".
