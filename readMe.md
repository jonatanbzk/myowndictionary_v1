MyOwnDictionary
===============

MyOwnDictionary is an open source project wich aims to help people who are learning foreign languages.
You can create your "dictionary" with two selected languages, and then, add words who you learn.
After that you can look at your dictionary or use the test fonction to check if you know the words you
learnt and their translation.

3. Registration :  captcha.
